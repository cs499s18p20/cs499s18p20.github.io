                 Up to this week, along with the rest of my team, I have mainly been organizing and setting up how the rest of the semester will 
                 play out. We met last Saturday (2/03/2018) for a few hours in order to plan out our schedule for the remaining weeks of the 
                 semester, detailing what we hope to accomplish and how long each step to the end goal will take. In addition, we collaborated in
                 writing out the requirements, seen <a href="https://cs499s18p20.github.io/requirements.html">here</a>. 
                 Since we had a new team member join us, I helped catch her up to speed as to what we discussed with the customers when we met 
                 them for the first time, as well as edited the webpage to include her information.
              </br>
              </br>
                 Additionally, I have been attempting to get through a <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">TensorFlow tutorial</a> 
                 that our customers recommended we test out before delving any deeper into the project. It has proven to be difficult on Windows 10,
                 so I am still in the process of modifying some of the steps given to accommodate my machine.

                Baby Steps

                This week, I was finally able to complete the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">TensorFlow tutorial</a>
                mentioned in last week's update. Thanks to Donald's suggestion, I used the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Shell</a>
                to finish working through the steps of the tutorial. This allowed us to become more fimiliar with TensorFlow and 
                TensorBoard, as well as get an idea of how to train and test on annotated images.
              </br>
              </br>
                The rest of the week mainly consisted of data collection. We focused on collecting images of four cards: the ace of diamonds,
                the king of hearts, the queen of hearts, and the jack of hearts. Each of us took 60 pictures of each card in different
                angles and positions on varying backgrounds. This is in order to create a very diverse training set, allowing
                for image recognition to be more inclusive. After taking the various images, I labeled each one using an 
                <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">LabelImg</a>, a program created solely to annotate images. A main 
                portion of this project relies on a wide and various data set to train on - to accomplish this, our
                plan is to repeat this data collection and annotation process during the upcoming weeks for more cards.

                Growing Pains

              <p class="card-text">
                The whole process of this project is very new to all of us, but we are definitely learning! We quickly realized that our
                images from last week were way too large for our training model. We decided to re-size our images to a width of 320 pixels, 
                preparing for if we decide to create a mobile application. Because we re-size all of our images, this meant we also had to
                re-annotate all of our images. Another problem we ran into was the inconsistency amongst all of our labelling formats. To 
                avoid this problem, we communicated to annotate our images by utilizing a modified version of "camel case", in which the
                first word's first letter is also capitalized (ex: AceOfDiamonds). 
              </br>
              </br>
                We focused the rest of our time in preparing for the Midterm Presentation. My team member Adam Walls put together a draft
                of a PowerPoint presentation earlier this week and I modified and edited it, creating a second version. Adam's version focused
                on content (he did a wonderful job with this!), while mine was more focused on communicating the information in a concise 
                manner that anyone without prior knowledge of the subject would be able to understand. We planned to meet today to practice 
                the presentation before our PresentationU appointment, scheduled for next week.

                Reality-Check
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                When we were first assigned this project, we assumed that our end goal would be to be able to identify different types
                of poker hands in an image of playing cards. However, after we met with our customers the first week, we realized that this
                was more of a stretch goal and would most likely not be achieved due to the lack of time. This week, we sat down and discussed
                our priorities. We all realized that we wanted to be able to create a fully functioning model, rather than one that had limitations. The limitations
                would be caused by the fact that we would not have enough time to train on all 52 cards. In order to achieve our goal of a complete
                model, we decided to change the game of poker to one of euchre, since it only requires 24 cards, rather than the whole deck. 
                Though the game is different, the idea is the same: we want to be able to recognize different types of euchre hands in an image
                of playing cards.
              </br>
              </br>
                We also started to prepare for our Midterm Presentation. On Monday, we went to PresentationU to get feedback on our slides. 
                We ran through our presentation in an informal manner with a student worker. At the end, she spoke about things she enjoyed regarding
                the slides and things she thought we could improve. She mentioned that she liked the way we all were able to clearly communicate
                what our project is about to someone that has no background in the Computer Science field. She was overall impressed with our
                presentation, but did suggest that we change a couple slides that were too wordy. We also realized that some of the requirements
                we first put on our website and our slides were outdated. We met on Sunday to go through the slides, in order to edit the 
                more wordy slides and to update our requirements and schedule.
              </br>
              </br>
               As usual, we added more cards to our training set. Each week we set to add 60 images of 4 cards each. This week we added and
               annotated the Ace of Hearts, King of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds, and Jack of Diamonds. Euchre only requires the 9, 10, Jack,
               Queen, King, and Ace of each suit, so we are getting good progress on our training set. We currently have half the suits of the
               Jack, Queen, King, and Ace cards. Now that we have switched games and updated how we plan to continue throughout the semester,
               we all feel much more comfortable and excited about the coming weeks and how our end project will play out!

                During Week 5, we presented our Midterm Presentation on Friday, March 9, 2018. For the days leading up to it, we mainly
                focused on editing and practicing our slides. Our main goal for the presentation was, of course, to meet all the requirements
                of what to communicate to the audience, but also to make the content as clear as possible. For example, the slides I presented
                were focused on conveying background information on neural nets - a topic which can get very complicated very quickly. Because of this,
                I spent the week figuring out the best way to keep the explanation as detailed, yet simple as possible. In addition, we pracitced our
                presentation many times. We wanted each other's feedback on the sections we were presenting, noting if there was anything we should modify.
                We also went through many dry runs for the sake of perfecting our delivery - many of us hadn't presented in a while and were a little rusty
                on speaking in front of an audience. Thanks to the large amount of practice, our midterm presentation went extremely smoothely.
              </br>
              </br>
                We also continued to collect images and annotations of cards throughout the two weeks. During Week 5, we completed our normal
                routine of 4 cards. However, we went over our schedule and realized - with the help of discussion with Dr. Piwowarski - that 
                we should block out more time to focus on the actual application as opposed to just the training dataset collection. To accomplish this,
                we decided to double up on collecting the images and annotations over Spring Break, meaning we created a training dataset for 8 cards
                over the week, rather than 8.

                This week, we finally finished collecting our training set! This means, we finished taking all the images of the cards needed in 
                Euchre and annotated each. Now that we are done, we have each taken and annotated roughly 1,440 images - 7,200 total!
                This is very exciting for al lof us because that was the most tedious portion of this project. We can now focus on the more exciting 
                aspects!
              </br>
              </br>
                After collecting the training set, we decided we wanted to focus our energy on creating a website next. As our customers suggested, this
                would be for ease of testing on our part, as well as a much more user-friendly approach that a command line. So far, I have 
                created the interface of our web application. I created a website using HTML and CSS, which is, at the moment, an outline of what we hope
                for it to include. The home page has a "browse" and "submit" button, allowing the user to upload an image and submit it to the server.
                There are a few other pages on the website, which will include more information about our project. Here are some images of the
                page so far:
