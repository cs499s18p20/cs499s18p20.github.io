                 Up to this week, along with the rest of my team, I have mainly been organizing and setting up how the rest of the semester will 
                 play out. We met last Saturday (2/03/2018) for a few hours in order to plan out our schedule for the remaining weeks of the 
                 semester, detailing what we hope to accomplish and how long each step to the end goal will take. In addition, we collaborated in
                 writing out the requirements, seen <a href="https://cs499s18p20.github.io/requirements.html">here</a>. 
                 Since we had a new team member join us, I helped catch her up to speed as to what we discussed with the customers when we met 
                 them for the first time, as well as edited the webpage to include her information.
              </br>
              </br>
                 Additionally, I have been attempting to get through a <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">TensorFlow tutorial</a> 
                 that our customers recommended we test out before delving any deeper into the project. It has proven to be difficult on Windows 10,
                 so I am still in the process of modifying some of the steps given to accommodate my machine.

                This week I was finally able to complete the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">TensorFlow tutorial</a>
                mentioned in last week's update. Thanks to Donald's suggestion, I used the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Shell</a>
                to finish working through the steps of the tutorial. This allowed us to become more fimiliar with TensorFlow and 
                TensorBoard, as well as get an idea of how to train and test on annotated images.
              </br>
              </br>
                The rest of the week mainly consisted of data collection. We focused on collecting images of four cards: the ace of diamonds,
                the king of hearts, the queen of hearts, and the jack of hearts. We each took 60 pictures of each card in different
                angles and positions on varying backgrounds. This is in order to create a very diverse training set, allowing
                for image recognition to be more inclusive. After taking the various images, I labeled each one using an 
                <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">LabelImg</a>, a prgram created solely to annotate images. Our
                hope is to repeat this process during the upcoming weeks for more cards.
