Since I'm posting this to this github (I plan to push to Donald's as well) 
I'm including a little directory tree below so that you can get an idea where everything goes to make this work:

-object_detection
    -deploy_server.py //code for the app- calls all templates
    -models
    -test_ckpt
      -output_inference_graph.pb
    -static
      -css
          -style.css //all css style, may want to separate later for better readability
      -images
          *where all the images go that the user uploads, need to add code that removes image after its dont
      -js
          -main.js //js that the main page uses
          -processCardList.js //js that is used for processing the card array
          -results.js //js for results page
      -webapp //images used for webapp design, probably should have given this a better name but oh well
          -bannerimg.jpg
          -placeholder.jpg
      -templates
          -aboutus.html 
          -base.html //base template-all other pages are built off of this 
          -howtouse.html
          -mainpg.html
          -userSubmissionResults.html //may want to make a separate page for recommendations after we get the array stuff workign
          -waiting.html
