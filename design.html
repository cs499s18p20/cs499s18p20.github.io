          <h1>Project Design</h1>
          <br>
          <h2>Overview</h2> 
          <p>            
            Our project involves creating a dataset of card images and labeling them in order to train a 
            neural network to identify playing cards from a standard deck. The cards that will be used for this project include those cards 
            involved in playing a game of Euchre, which includes all cards valued from 9 to A. This allows for a complete set of cards and 
            allows the group to create a web application to interface with the model. Once the model has been developed to accurately predict 
            any of the 24 possible cards in a Euchre deck, it will then be deployed onto our Web application. A server will host the model and 
            handle requests to identify cards within an image. 
          </p>
          <h2>Environments and Languages</h2>
          <p>
            The following tools and environments will be used to develop the neural network:
            <ul>
              <li>Linux/Unix OS, Mac OSX</li>  
              <li>TensorFlow: Google's open-source machine learning framework</li>
              <li>labelImg: An open-source image annotation tool</li>
              <li>Google Cloud Platform: Google's suite of cloud based computing services</li>
              <li>Python 2.7/3.6: The preferred programming language for working with TensorFlow</li>
              <li>PyScripter: A user-friendly, interactive Python IDE</li>
              <li>Internal tools: It is very likely that we will find it helpful to build some of our own tools (for example, a script to rotate 
                images in order to create more test images from a single picture). These will be added as we develop them. Stretch Goal 3 may be 
                another tool that we find useful. (Typically developed in Python)</li>
            </ul>      
          </p>
          <p>
            The following tools will be used to develop the web application:
            <ul>
              <li>Linux/Unix OS, Mac OSX, Windows 8.1/10</li>
              <li>Python 2.7/3.6: The preferred programming language for working with TensorFlow</li>
              <li>PyScripter: A user-friendly, interactive Python IDE</li>
              <li>Django: A Python framework used for developing server-side software</li>
              <li>HTML, CSS</li>
              <li>JavaScript: A versatile, interactive web programming language</li>

          <h2>Module Description and Data Flow</h2>                
          This image is the design for how the model is trained. The Gogle Cloud Platform is leveraged to make use of their powerful computer hardware
          instead of commercial hardware, which pales in comparison to the computing power of these GPUs. Using their Machine Learning Engine, a 
          card recognition model is developed to gain the ability to determine the cards provided in an image.

          <br>
          <br>
          This image is the web application design for the user interface. They would select an image from file explorer and select "send"
          to be sent to the server, which hosts the model, in order to evaluate what cards are in the hand.

          <h2>Model Development Interface</h2>      
          Training the model was usually performed from this screen: The Google Cloud Platform’s shell, which hosted a Linux environment 
          and proved especially useful for those with a Windows based PC.
          <br>

      </div>
      <div class="row">        
        <div class="col-lg-10 col-centered">          
          <h2>User Interface Design</h2>               
          First, the user will be able to go to the application web page and use this simple UI to upload a photo to the server.          
          <br>
          <img src="./photos/UI_Design.jpg">
          <br>
          <br>
          Once clicking “upload photo”, the user will then be shown a divided page: one side will hold their image along with the other 
          side showing a loading screen. 
          <br>
          <img src="./photos/User_Screen1.jpg">
          <br>
          <br>
          After the server has received the image, used the model to predict the cards held in the image, and returned the resulting image 
          and labels, the user will be shown a screen like this:
          <br>
          <img src = "./photos/User_Screen2.jpg">
          <br>
          <br>
        </div>  
      </div>
      <div class="row">        
        <div class="col-lg-10 col-centered">          
          <h2>User Scenarios</h2>      
          <ol>
            <li>User wants to see a single card isdentified by the model. So, they take an image from their webcam of a card they are interested in, 
            click on the browse button where their photos are stored, select the photo of the card, and click the upload photo button. Next, the
            app displays the user's image to them ansd lets the user know that it is attempting to label the card image. Then, the application sends
            the photo to the server, which labels the image, and sends it back to the user.</li>
