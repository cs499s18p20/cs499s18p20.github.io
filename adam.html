                I helped orchestrate meetings with the customers at Lexmark.
                On top of that, I attended group meetings to figure out requirements, play story point poker, 
                and determine the objective for the next several weeks. I also began researching the 
                Quick Start: Distributed Training on the Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset on Google Cloud tutorial found on 
                <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">
                    github.com
                </a> and tried to complete that to gain a better understanding of how to use neural networks (NNs) and train them.
               As I was running through this tutorial, I developed a batch script to aid my partners as they worked through the tutorial 
               as well.

                I got the project tuorial finally working thanks to Donald Venus's suggestions. Discovered that attempting to use
                Windows OS for this project is a horrible idea. Had I not used it, I may have been able to complete the tutorial much more quickly
                using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">google cloud shell.</a>
                <p>
                On top of that, I attended group meetings, since we had to schedule an extra one due to unforseen difficulties in the tutorial,
                to update the objective(s) for the next several weeks. We discussed requirement 2 and how to annotate the images and create the 
                training and validation sets needed for the neural network.
                </p>
                <p>
                I started development on a Python script to modify images and enable the team to take one image and generate several unique 
                images for the training and validation sets. It could use some improvements like a better UI and modifying the brightness of 
                the image and things of that nature, but it is still in early development.
                Now the real work begins with annotating the images.
                </p>

                Spent some time developing the project presentation Powerpoint slides. Also updated the script that modifies the annotation .xml files 
                created by the labelimg application. Specifically, I changed the file type in the path label to be set as a ".jpg" file. I also scheduled
                the group meeting times and discussed some tools we could use to make our lives easier when developing the project data and annotations. 
                Finaslly, I resized the images I contributed to the data set from 4000x3000 to 300x300 and had to re-annotate the images. We found that the image sizes were too large 
                and during training, they would consume ovver 100 GB of memory before the server would kill the training attempt. So, we realized thast we needed smaller 
                image resolutions to prevent this from happening.

                This week I added to the library of card images and annotations. On top of that, I discussed the project requirements and deliverables
                with the customers and whether they would prefer to have an entire library of cards or if they would prefer to have some type of interface.
                We came to the conclusion that we would be better served working on some type of web application for telling a user what type of hand we had.
                Chelsea Kuball had the great idea of making the most out of the smaller library and making it work for a card game called Euchre, which uses cards 
                9 - A. This would allow us to have a complete library for the game without taking 5000+ photos and annotations. It would leave room for other groups to 
                add games to the application and more to the library.
