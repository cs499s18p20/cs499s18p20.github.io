                I helped orchestrate meetings with the customers at Lexmark.
                On top of that, I attended group meetings to figure out requirements, play story point poker, 
                and determine the objective for the next several weeks. I also began researching the 
                Quick Start: Distributed Training on the Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset on Google Cloud tutorial found on 
                <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">
                    github.com
                </a> and tried to complete that to gain a better understanding of how to use neural networks (NNs) and train them.
               As I was running through this tutorial, I developed a batch script to aid my partners as they worked through the tutorial 
               as well.

                I got the project tuorial finally working thanks to Donald Venus's suggestions. Discovered that attempting to use
                Windows OS for this project is a horrible idea. Had I not used it, I may have been able to complete the tutorial much more quickly
                using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">google cloud shell.</a>
                <p>
                On top of that, I attended group meetings, since we had to schedule an extra one due to unforseen difficulties in the tutorial,
                to update the objective(s) for the next several weeks. We discussed requirement 2 and how to annotate the images and create the 
                training and validation sets needed for the neural network.
                </p>
                <p>
                I started development on a Python script to modify images and enable the team to take one image and generate several unique 
                images for the training and validation sets. It could use some improvements like a better UI and modifying the brightness of 
                the image and things of that nature, but it is still in early development.
                Now the real work begins with annotating the images.

                Spent some time developing the project presentation Powerpoint slides. Also updated the script that modifies the annotation .xml files 
                created by the labelimg application. Specifically, I changed the file type in the path label to be set as a ".jpg" file. I also scheduled
                the group meeting times and discussed some tools we could use to make our lives easier when developing the project data and annotations. 
                Finaslly, I resized the images I contributed to the data set from 4000x3000 to 300x300 and had to re-annotate the images. We found that the image sizes were too large 
                and during training, they would consume ovver 100 GB of memory before the server would kill the training attempt. So, we realized thast we needed smaller 
                image resolutions to prevent this from happening.

                This week I added to the library of card images and annotations. On top of that, I discussed the project requirements and deliverables
                with the customers and whether they would prefer to have an entire library of cards or if they would prefer to have some type of interface.
                We came to the conclusion that we would be better served working on some type of web application for telling a user what type of hand we had.
                Chelsea Kuball had the great idea of making the most out of the smaller library and making it work for a card game called Euchre, which uses cards 
                9 - A. This would allow us to have a complete library for the game without taking 5000+ photos and annotations. It would leave room for other groups to 
                add games to the application and more to the library.
                We met with the Presentation U! member and went over our project. They had glowing comments for our presentation and liked the 
                amount of visuals in it.
                I created the design block diagrams for the project design. The two images were composed of the design for the web application and
                the design for the model and how it is developed.

                The first thing I, and the rest of the group did was work on our midterm project presentation. We went over who
                would cover what parts of the project, what we would like improved and changed for our latest requirement updates,
                and performed dry runs of our presentations before the presentation occurred. On Friday, March 9th, the group presented the 
                current project status and what we were hoping to do with the model going forward. 
                This week(s) I continued adding to the image and annotation data sets and began looking into how to set up a web server using Flask
                and implementing a RESTful API. The team decided to double up on the amount of cards to add to the dat set since we 
                would have more time during Spring break. I found some promising results for a server 
                <a href="http://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/receiving-files-with-a-flask-rest-api/">here</a> and 
                <a href="https://guillaumegenthial.github.io/serving.html">here</a>.
                I tested a simple server from <a href="https://gist.github.com/bradmontgomery/2219997">this site</a> as well. While it
                allowed for simple post requests, our project needs to be able to send and receive images to provide the required functionality. So,
                I plan to continue researching how to implement such a server.
                The group is very excited about development so far.

                I completed my round of contributions to all of the cards included in a Euchre deck. I also emailed the customers about 
                project updates, how the presentation went, and their thoughts on implementing a recommendation system for the Euchre-based
                application and if it would be feasible to work on a neural network during the last few weeks of the semester. 
                On top of those developments, I plan on digging into the server application to see if there are any possible improvements
                for the improving processing speed. It uses matplotlib, which I have some prior experience using for some CS460G 
                assignments here at UK.
                I set up an initial testing plan, which was shared  with the group so we could contribute our own testing
                ideas to each of the project components. The customers provided some feedback on the project and recommended that 
                the group focus on completing the application before considering any work on a neural netwrok-based recommendation system.
