          <h1>Project Requirements</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>Essential Requirements</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Successful reproduction of an object recognition tutorial.</strong> We will be following 
              <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">this guide</a> that was shared with us by 
              the customer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creation of a library of annotated simple card images.</strong> This library of images will be used throughout the project to train the model. 
              As we work to improve the model to recognize more advanced patterns, this library will be expanded as necessary for training. Annotation will likely be 
              done using <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">this tool</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Addition of simple "card objects" to the model trained in the object recognition tutorial.</strong> This will require adding our library of 
              annotated card images to the training data used in the tutorial. The goal here is to have the neural net successfully recognize and identify images of 
              cards. It will not be able to identify suit or value at this point.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Removal of the original dataset from the tutorial.</strong> This will leave our model with only the card images to train from and will be a 
              turning point in that our project will now be quite disjoint from the original tutorial we started with.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Addition of the ability to differentiate between suits of cards.</strong> This may or may not cover all 4 suits depending on the time remaining 
              once we reach this point in the project. The original goal will be to differentiate between two different suits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Addition of the ability to differentiate between numbers of cards.</strong> This will not likely cover all 13 different values since that would 
              require the creation of a massive library of annotated images. It should be able to differentiate between a specifically chosen group of card values.         
            </li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Ability to identify all 52 cards.</strong> This is an extension on the last two essential requirements and just expands these to cover all cards
              in the deck. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ability to identify overlapping and truncated card images.</strong> This would require the creation of a new dataset of images that would allow
              us to train the model to recognize cards even in these non-ideal forms. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile or web interface to allow remote image identification.</strong> This would allow a user to take an image on their phone and submit it
              to the neural net and receive immediate feedback about what cards are in the image. 
            </li>
          </ol>
          <hr>
          <h2>Schedule and Milestones</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 1:</strong> Finish Tutorial (Requirement 1) and successfully run using Google Cloud Platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 2:</strong> Finish creation of simple dataset (Requirement 2) and train the existing model to see if it is able to
              properly recognize the images of cards (Requirement 3).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 3:</strong> Refine the simple dataset and continue working with the model until it is able to successfully recognize all
              simple card images in the dataset (Requirement 3).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 4:</strong> Remove the original training data from the model leaving only the card images (Requirement 4).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 5:</strong> Continue to refine existing model, potentially adding more images to the training sets until it is correctly
              able to identify all cards in the test dataset. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 6:</strong> Begin training and testing with the next level dataset to train differentiation between suits (Requirement 5).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 7:</strong> Continue work from week 6 (Requirement 5).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 8:</strong> Begin training and testing with the next level dataset to train differentiation between card values (Requirement 6).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 9:</strong> Continue work from week 8 (Requirement 6) and add more suits and values if possible (Stretch 1).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Week 10:</strong> Attempt to train overlapping, obstructed, and truncated card image recognition (Stretch 2).
            </li>

          <h2>Sizing Estimate</h2>
		  <div>
		  <p>
			 Story points are used to estimate the size and difficulty of the project.
		  </p>
		  <p>These points range from 1, for the least difficult of tasks, to 100, for the most difficult 
		     tasks known to man (think np hard problems).

              Internal tools: It is very likely that we will find it helpful to build some of our own tools (for example, a script to rotate images in order
              to create more test images from a single picture). These will be added as we develop them. Stretch Goal 3 may be another tool that we find useful.
