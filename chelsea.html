                Getting Started

                The main goal for me this week was to become more comfortable using TensorFlow through various tutorials. I began research by first completing a simple tutorial for image detection. 
                <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0d">This tutorial</a>
                  retrained Google's Inception V3 model or MobileNet model to classify different types of flowers in an image. At the end I was able to give the model a photo of a sunflower and have it classify it correctly with 98% certainty.
                  <br>
             <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">The other tutorial</a>
                I worked on is the one provided by our customer. The tutorial helped me learn how to use the Google Cloud Platform in addition to an introduction into object recognition. 
                This one was a bit tougher to get working, as it was written to run on an earlier version of the git repo I had downloaded for TensorFlow. Luckily Donald found a way around this by resetting the model directory back to the correct version. 
                With the help of this fix I was able to get it off the ground and training. I used TensorBoard to monitor the model as it trained. 
                An example of how TensorBoard can be used to monitor learning progress has been provided below.

                All in all this was a successful week and I look forward to seeing how we can build off of the provided tutorial to tailor it to our needs!

                Data Collection and Experimentation 
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                  On Monday (2/12) I installed LabelImg, a program for annotating images. I fed it a few jpgs to test, drew some boxes around some playing cards, labeled them with the class "playing card", and then inspected the resulting xml files that the program output. I then started collecting data for our project by scraping about 70 images of the queen of hearts from the web and by taking about 30 images of the card with my phone. I've shared a screenshot below of what annotating looks like on LabelImg.

                  <br>
                  As just a small experiment, I fed this small data set into the RCNN model we used for the pets tutorial last week just to see what it did. I succeeded in getting it running and training, however it was having difficulty drawing boxes with the test images. I believe this is due to the small data set, I also only let it run for about 20 minutes before stopping it to save credits.

                  <br>
                  I believe this was a great week! The group is going to start with a data set of 4 cards and then test locally on it to learn more about what goes into feeding a custom data set to a model. Once we get those four cards working we plan to add more until we can get a full deck and train with a full data set of a deck of cards on the model using GCP.
