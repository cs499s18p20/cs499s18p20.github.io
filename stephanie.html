                This week's activities revolved around meetings and tutorial work. I attended our group meeting 
                with the Lexmark customers, who described the project in more detail, outlined what portions of 
                it we will be addressing over this semester, and showed us examples of similar image-processing 
                based projects for reference. Later on, my teammates and I met again to discuss how to best approach 
                the tasks we were assigned. 
                <br>
                To familiarize myself with both the software we'll be using and the general concepts behind our project,
                I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">
                    object recognition tutorial
                </a> that was provided to the group by one of the Lexmark customers. I'm also trying to 
                learn more about neural nets through introductory lectures on YouTube.

		            Because I was one of the three people who were using Windows to
                complete the object recognition tutorial, I had a few extra issues
                to overcome at the beginning of this week. Even with trying various shells, attempts to translate
                the tutorial's Linux commands into something Windows-friendly, and much
                re-downloading of Python versions and other necessary files, I was able to get only
                halfway through the tutorial at first. However, thanks to my teammates' suggestions, I finally 
                got the tutorial to work using the web browser based shell in my Google Cloud Platform account!
                <br>
                Once everyone was caught up with the unexpectedly difficult tutorial process, the group met
                to discuss more specifics. We are now at a stage where we can start developing a dataset for initial training.
                Specifically, we decided to start working on four individual cards: the queen of hearts, the jack of
                hearts, the king of hearts, and the ace of diamonds. Each person in the group will provide at least
                60 annotated (with <a href=https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg>labelImg</a>) images of each of these
                cards, which will be collected in a Google Drive folder so that we can more easily pool them into a 
                shared Google Cloud bucket. This way, we get the maximum usage out of our Google Cloud credits and 
                the training proper can all be done cohesively on one machine even though the image annotation work will be 
                split evenly among the group members.
                <br>
                As far as personal progress in this regard goes, I have annotated my 60 images for each of these cards. Here's 
                hoping the upcoming training will go well!

                To fix memory issues we were encountering during training, this week was devoted to resizing the original 
	        overly large images that were taken of the four cards from last week. Additionally, since it was already 
	        necessary to re-annotate the smaller images, this time we made sure to normalize how everyone annotated the card 
		names. I first reduced my images to 240x320 pixels from their original size of 3024x4032 pixels, then changed my 
	        annotations so that the card names are now written as "AceOfDiamonds", "KingOfHearts", and so on. No new cards 
		were assigned this week so that we can be sure our current method works before taking and annotating many more images.
		<br>
		We also have our Presentation U practice set up for Monday, 2/26/2018, and our actual midterm presentation coming 
		up soon, so the group set aside some time to rehearse everyone's parts.

		After discussing the direction of our project a little more with our customers -- and given the amount of time we 
		have left in the semester -- we've decided to work with a smaller pool of cards so we can make an interactive web 
		interface and get a little more programming in for the project. Since we wouldn't be able to make a complete library 
		of poker hands without the full deck, Chelsea brought up a different game called Euchre, which only uses 9-A from 
		each suit. This will allow us to have a more complete end product as far as the website goes, and gives us a more 
		solid direction to take with our choices for the cards we will be annotating.
		<br>
		This Monday, we did our practice run of the midterm presentation at Presentation U and got very nice positive feedback
		from the employee who worked with us. Our usage of images throughout the slides went over well and enhanced the points 
		each of us was trying to verbally get across. We were also told that our descriptions were detailed enough that a 
		non-CS-major audience would easily be able to understand our presentation. 
		<br>
		We've achieved great progress so far in training the neural net! It now seems to be getting most of its guesses right 
		(at least for the current library of images). Since
		the smaller images are already proving to be working much better, four more cards were assigned for the week: Ace of 
		Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, King of Diamonds, and Queen of Diamonds. I have finished my share of these pictures and 
		annotations and added them to our training library.

		A lot of our focus during the work week of 3/5/2018 - 3/9/2018 was devoted to polishing up our midterm presentation for that
		Friday, 3/9/2018. We first followed the advice from our Presentation U practice run, modifying the wordier slides (requirements
		and schedule/milestones) so that they matched the more visual, easy to follow format of the other slides. From there, most of
 		the slides were adjusted further from the version we used at Presentation U, whether because of issues with flow of the presentation
		or because of the change in direction of our project since we had first drafted the slides. The ones that arguably required the most 
		modification were, again, requirements and summary/schedule/milestones, as these needed to be almost completely overhauled for both the
		presentation and the website.
		<br>
		Once we had established a more cohesive and up-to-date version of our original presentation, we did final runs of our transitions,
		timing, and what each of us should and shouldn't address in our sections of the presentation. Since I was handling requirements and
		Chelsea was handling summary/schedule/milestones, we made sure that the points we were making matched up but weren't redundant.
		<br>
		<br>
		Due to the extra time spring break provides, we assigned eight cards to be photographed and annotated for the training library this
		time: the Ace, Jack, King, and Queen of the Clubs and Spades suits. This leaves us with only the 9 and 10 of all four suits to add
 		to the library for our full Euchre card deck, so this is great progress! We will be starting on the website part of the project soon,
		so I've recently been looking through some <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/overview/">Django</a> and <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Flask</a> 
		overviews since I have no former experience with either.

              <p class="card-text">
		This past week, all of us made the push to finish the last eight cards required for our Euchre library. I used some of my spring 
		break time to take pictures of all of the 9s and 10s in advance, so I was able to focus on knocking out the annotations for
		everything I had left. It's very nice to have this more monotonous work out of the way! We will now have a fully trained model, 
	        and if its performance is high enough (our previous training iterations' trend in precision indicates that it likely will be), 
		we can proceed to the next step of creating another smaller library of more complex images for the test set, since it is not 
		good practice for neural nets to test on training set data. This will be a part of our formal testing for the project as well.
		<br>
		We are now beginning the more exciting phase of our project: actually building the website application! Our customers recommended 
		that we focus on this now so that we would have both a more polished end product and an easier time with testing. Chelsea and 
		Rupal were already able to lay out excellent ground work for the server and client sides of the website, so in the next few weeks 
		I and my other teammates will be working to connect them and to add a little more to the interface for ease of use.
