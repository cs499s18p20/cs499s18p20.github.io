                This week's activities revolved around meetings and tutorial work. I attended our group meeting 
                with the Lexmark customers, who described the project in more detail, outlined what portions of 
                it we will be addressing over this semester, and showed us examples of similar image-processing 
                based projects for reference. Later on, my teammates and I met again to discuss how to best approach 
                the tasks we were assigned. 
                <br>
                To familiarize myself with both the software we'll be using and the general concepts behind our project,
                I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md">
                    object recognition tutorial
                </a> that was provided to the group by one of the Lexmark customers. I'm also trying to 
                learn more about neural nets through introductory lectures on YouTube.

		            Because I was one of the three people who were using Windows to
                complete the object recognition tutorial, I had a few extra issues
                to overcome at the beginning of this week. Even with trying various shells, attempts to translate
                the tutorial's Linux commands into something Windows-friendly, and much
                re-downloading of Python versions and other necessary files, I was able to get only
                halfway through the tutorial at first. However, thanks to my teammates' suggestions, I finally 
                got the tutorial to work using the web browser based shell in my Google Cloud Platform account!
                <br>
                Once everyone was caught up with the unexpectedly difficult tutorial process, the group met
                to discuss more specifics. We are now at a stage where we can start developing a dataset for initial training.
                Specifically, we decided to start working on four individual cards: the queen of hearts, the jack of
                hearts, the king of hearts, and the ace of diamonds. Each person in the group will provide at least
                60 annotated (with <a href=https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg>labelImg</a>) images of each of these
                cards, which will be collected in a Google Drive folder so that we can more easily pool them into a 
                shared Google Cloud bucket. This way, we get the maximum usage out of our Google Cloud credits and 
                the training proper can all be done cohesively on one machine even though the image annotation work will be 
                split evenly among the group members.
                <br>
                As far as personal progress in this regard goes, I have annotated my 60 images for each of these cards. Here's 
                hoping the upcoming training will go well!

                To fix memory issues we were encountering during training, this week was devoted to resizing the original 
	        overly large images that were taken of the four cards from last week. Additionally, since it was already 
	        necessary to re-annotate the smaller images, this time we made sure to normalize how everyone annotated the card 
		names. I first reduced my images to 240x320 pixels from their original size of 3024x4032 pixels, then changed my 
	        annotations so that the card names are now written as "AceOfDiamonds", "KingOfHearts", and so on. No new cards 
		were assigned this week so that we can be sure our current method works before taking and annotating many more images.
		<br>
		We also have our Presentation U practice set up for Monday, 2/26/2018, and our actual midterm presentation coming 
		up soon, so the group set aside some time to rehearse everyone's parts.
