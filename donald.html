                Beginning the project
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This was the first week that we really got started with our project. We previously met with our customer, 
                hammered out the initial ideas for our requirements and put together a pretty simple schedule to at
                least keep us on the right path for the next few weeks until we can put together something of more substance.
                According to our requirements and our schedule, this first week was originally planned to be the week that we
                finished the object-recognition tutorial hosted by Google on the TensorFlow repository. We determined
                that it would probably be best if each of us did the tutorial independantly to get familiar with the tools
                that we will be using throughout the semester. In the end, we did achieve this goal, but just barely. I was
                the only one on the team to use a linux machine to work through the tutorial, and it soon became obvious
                that it was really designed for linux and not windows so I had a much easier time than most of the team. 
                Another team member had a mac which also proved to work quite well with the tutorial.
                <br>
                <br>
                This wasn't the only issue we ran into, however. The tutorial had been designed to work with TensorFlow 1.2. 
                This posed a problem since the rest of the TensorFlow repository had changed very significantly since 1.2
                which rendered the tutorial out-of-date and incorrect in some cases. After working through it, I was 
                unable to get any of my training
                jobs to start successfully on the cloud platform. After doing some research, trying a number of fixes, and
                ultimately starting about 10 failed jobs, I was able to find a fix. Luckily, with github, it is easy to roll
                back a repository to a previous state. So, by rolling the entire TensorFlow repository back to 1.2, I was finally
                able to get the tutorial to work and run machine learning training and evaluation jobs on the Google Cloud
                Platform. Unfortunately all of the team didn't reach this point 
                (trying to do this with Windows is significantly more
                challenging) but I think since we did get most of the way there, we can call this week a success! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I originally
                trained the model using a "standard_cpu" machine offered by Google Cloud Platform but that proved to be incredibly
                slow (20 seconds per simulation step). By changing to using 5 "standard_gpu" machines, this sped up to about 1
                second per step and the model was able to converge and predict with relatively high accuracy the breeds of
                cats and dogs based on images (this was the purpose of the tutorial). For the time being, we will probably
                continue to work with TensorFlow 1.2 but may revisit using TensorFlow 1.4 in the future. TensorFlow 1.4 was 
                released very recently and still doesn't seem to fully work on Google Cloud Platform anyway, so I don't think
                this is a huge loss. Moving forward, our next goal will be to add annotated images of cards to the
                current dataset containing cats and dogs. The idea is to get the model to accurately identify cards as separate
                objects than cats and dogs. It should be a fun week!

                Creating the Initial Dataset
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This week, the primary focus was creating an initial dataset to start training a model that can identify playing
                cards in images. In order to accomplish this, we selected 4 cards (Jack of hearts, Queen of hearts, King of hearts,
                and Ace of diamonds) to begin testing with. The main goal here is to train the model to recognize these 4 cards
                and be able to identify them in images. As part of this, I took ~240 images (60 of each card) and used the program
                <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">labelImg</a> in order to annotate them. These annotations are
                necessary so that the model can learn what each of the cards look like. In addition, I spent some time researching
                the different configurations that can be used when doing training. It is very likely that we will have to play with
                these configurations in order to get the results we desire. This next week, we will be working to
                train the model and will evaluate its performance using a portion of the images we gathered. Depending on its
                performance, we will either need to further refine the model to identify these four cards or will be able to 
                start adding more cards to the training set.
