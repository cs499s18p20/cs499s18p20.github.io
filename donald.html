                Beginning the project
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This was the first week that we really got started with our project. We previously met with our customer, 
                hammered out the initial ideas for our requirements and put together a pretty simple schedule to at
                least keep us on the right path for the next few weeks until we can put together something of more substance.
                According to our requirements and our schedule, this first week was originally planned to be the week that we
                finished the object-recognition tutorial hosted by Google on the TensorFlow repository. We determined
                that it would probably be best if each of us did the tutorial independantly to get familiar with the tools
                that we will be using throughout the semester. In the end, we did achieve this goal, but just barely. I was
                the only one on the team to use a linux machine to work through the tutorial, and it soon became obvious
                that it was really designed for linux and not windows so I had a much easier time than most of the team. 
                Another team member had a mac which also proved to work quite well with the tutorial.
                <br>
                <br>
                This wasn't the only issue we ran into, however. The tutorial had been designed to work with TensorFlow 1.2. 
                This posed a problem since the rest of the TensorFlow repository had changed very significantly since 1.2
                which rendered the tutorial out-of-date and incorrect in some cases. After working through it, I was 
                unable to get any of my training
                jobs to start successfully on the cloud platform. After doing some research, trying a number of fixes, and
                ultimately starting about 10 failed jobs, I was able to find a fix. Luckily, with github, it is easy to roll
                back a repository to a previous state. So, by rolling the entire TensorFlow repository back to 1.2, I was finally
                able to get the tutorial to work and run machine learning training and evaluation jobs on the Google Cloud
                Platform. Unfortunately all of the team didn't reach this point 
                (trying to do this with Windows is significantly more
                challenging) but I think since we did get most of the way there, we can call this week a success! 
                <br>
                <br>
                I originally
                trained the model using a "standard_cpu" machine offered by Google Cloud Platform but that proved to be incredibly
                slow (20 seconds per simulation step). By changing to using 5 "standard_gpu" machines, this sped up to about 1
                second per step and the model was able to converge and predict with relatively high accuracy the breeds of
                cats and dogs based on images (this was the purpose of the tutorial). For the time being, we will probably
                continue to work with TensorFlow 1.2 but may revisit using TensorFlow 1.4 in the future. TensorFlow 1.4 was 
                released very recently and still doesn't seem to fully work on Google Cloud Platform anyway, so I don't think
                this is a huge loss. Moving forward, our next goal will be to add annotated images of cards to the
                current dataset containing cats and dogs. The idea is to get the model to accurately identify cards as separate
                objects than cats and dogs. It should be a fun week!

                Creating the Initial Dataset
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This week, the primary focus was creating an initial dataset to start training a model that can identify playing
                cards in images. In order to accomplish this, we selected 4 cards (Jack of hearts, Queen of hearts, King of hearts,
                and Ace of diamonds) to begin testing with. The main goal here is to train the model to recognize these 4 cards
                and be able to identify them in images. As part of this, I took ~240 images (60 of each card) and used the program
                <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">labelImg</a> in order to annotate them. These annotations are
                necessary so that the model can learn what each of the cards look like. In addition, I spent some time researching
                the different configurations that can be used when doing training. It is very likely that we will have to play with
                these configurations in order to get the results we desire. This next week, we will be working to
                train the model and will evaluate its performance using a portion of the images we gathered. Depending on its
                performance, we will either need to further refine the model to identify these four cards or will be able to 
                start adding more cards to the training set.

                Promising Initial Results!
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This week, we used the images collected last week to begin training a TensorFlow model to detect cards in images.
                My primary contribution this week was taking all of the images the group collected last week and using them to
                train a model on the Google Cloud Platform. While originally I thought this task would be fairly straightforward
                (after going through the tutorial a couple weeks ago), I soon found that this was going to be quite the involved
                task. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Slight differences in the annotations and filenames used by each individual for the card images made just
                getting the data set into a standard form quite the challenge. After that, altering the tutorial to actually use
                our data set instead of the pets data set required the manipulation of a large number of scripts and configuration
                files. In order to facilitate this, I set up a new repository <a href="http://github.com/donaldvenus/models">here</a>
                that contains all of the new files for the cards data set as well as all the important library files necessary
                to properly setup a model for training on the cloud. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The next issue was the fact that we used rather large images (in some cases images with 4k resolution!). This was such 
                an issue that we actually kept running into memory issues on the cloud with our memory usage surpassing 80 gigabytes for
                training. We would always hit the memory cap and cause the job to fail. After doing some research online, I was able to
                resolve this by limiting the batch queue size at the expense of training speed.
                <br>
                <br>
                After finally getting the job to successfully run for about 2 hours on 10 cloud-based GPUs, we began to get some very
                promising results. The images below show the identifications that the neural net was able to make after this training.
                As you can see, the results are very promising, but they are definitely not perfect and there is still a lot of room
                for improvement.
                <br>

                <img src="./photos/initial_results_1.png">
                <br>
                This image shows the correct identification of a King of Hearts with 99% certainty!
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="./photos/initial_results_2.png">
                <br>
                This image shows the proper identification of a card object but as you can see, it is mislabled as a King of Hearts rather
                than a Queen of Hearts. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="./photos/initial_results_3.png">
                <br>
                This image shows the proper identification of the King of Hearts with 97% certainty but the misidentification of a tag hanging
                from the blinds as a Queen of Hearts.
                <br>
                <br>
                In order to improve our results, we decided to resize all of our images down to about 320x240 pixels. This serves the purpose
                of greatly speeding up the training time as well as allowing our model to generalize better since it is less likely to
                overtrain on low resolution images. For my contribution, I resized and reannotated all 240 of the images I took
                last week. This week we will be training with these new smaller images and I am excited to see
                what kind of results we are able to achieve.

                Updating the Requirements
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">
                This week marked a shift in our goals for the rest of the semester. Given our rapid progress in identifying cards (we are
                currently able to identify individual cards, bypassing the adding suits and adding values parts of the project), we have
                decided to shift our requirements to better reflect this. We will continue to add more cards to the dataset but will begin
                work simultaneously on a simple web application that will allow users to interface with our trained card detection model.
                <br>
                <br>
                My main contribution this week was using the smaller images created last week to train a new model using the Google Cloud
                Platform. Our results were even more promising than the first dataset and we are excited to include this progress in our
                presentation this week. It was also nice to see how quickly this new model trained compared to the model trained with the
                much larger images. My other contributions were helping to prepare the presentation for this week and updating the
                introduction and requirements web pages to reflect the shift in our requirements for the semester.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also meant to add another 240 images to our dataset like the rest of the group but was unable to complete that this 
                weekend. I have all of the images and have started annotating them, but I will have to catch up this week and finish
                that up in addition to my work for this week.

              <p class="card-text">
                These last two weeks our group presented to the class, started designing our web application after updating our requirements
                and then continuing wrapping up our annotations so that we can focus on the more exciting aspects of our project moving forward!
                <br>
                <br>
                My primary contributions these last two weeks were finishing my share of the annotations for all 24 cards that we are working
                to identify! In total, I completed annotations for ~960 images in the last two weeks. It is a big weight off my shoulders now
                since these annotations were definitely the most grueling and dull part of the project. In addition, I was able to successfully
                freeze a prediction model (a model that will not train further and will only make predictions) and shared it with my team so that
                we can develop around it for our web application.
                <br>
                <br>
                This week, I will be retraining our model with the new annotations we have and testing its performance. As long as our precision
                continues to be high, I don't foresee any major issues with this part of our project. I will also start the process of making a
                dedicated test image set which is standard practice for this kind of work based on what I've found through research. So far we have
                just been randomly selecting images from our training set to use as the test set but this is not ideal. Lastly, I would like to 
                work on the frontend design of the web application, but I will see how much time I have.

                This week our team started the development of a test plan and finished annotating our entire data set.
                Since our dataset is now complete, I adjusted our training code to handle all 24 cards in order to
                prepare for final training. Unfortunately I was unable to train a new model this week as anticipated,
                but that should be happening in the next day or two. Adjusting the training code to handle all 24 cards
                took more work than expected. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, this week I will help to develop our test plan and as part of that start setting aside
                a special test data set to use specifically for testing our final model. I will also contribute to the
                client-side code for our web application since we now have a basic design up. This last week proved to be
                significantly more busy than I thought so I accomplished less than I hoped to, but this week should
                be much better in that regard.
